## How does it work?

Documentation is available on the [wiki][2]. It includes a brief overview of our
setup, as well as instructions for getting started.

If you're curious about how things work, feel free to take a look around. Most
of the files have comments explaining what they do.

Yep! Our code is designed to work with our hardware, but you should be able to
adapt it to your own needs with a little work. Just make sure you
